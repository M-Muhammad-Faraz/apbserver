Create a Node.js server and set up a MySQL connection.

Create a route that handles the teacher starting the digital classroom. When the route is accessed, it should:

Fetch the students that are associated with the lecture using the lecture_student table.
Start a socket.io connection and emit an event to all the students that are associated with the lecture, notifying them that the classroom has started.
Create a client-side application that the students can use to join the digital classroom. When the student joins the classroom, they should:
Connect to the socket.io server.
Listen for the event emitted by the server when the classroom starts and join the classroom.
When a student joins the classroom, their name should be added to the list of attendees.
When a student leaves the classroom, their name should be added to the list of absentees or exceptions, depending on the reason they left.
Create a route that handles the teacher stopping the digital classroom. When the route is accessed, it should:
Close the socket.io connection.
Save the list of attendees, absentees and exceptions to a CSV file.
Implement authentication and security measures to ensure that only authorized teachers can start and stop digital classrooms, and only authorized students can join them.
You can use the above steps as a guide to implement your own digital classroom feature. Keep in mind that this is a high-level overview and there are many details you will need to consider when implementing this feature.
